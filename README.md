• Built a clone of the popular “Wordle” game with Create-React-App, where the player guesses a randomly selected word of a fixed length in certain numbers of attempts. 
• Used Redux for state management and React hook for re-rendering control, enabling the validation of user’s guess and the display of corresponding hints.
• Created responsive UI that adapts to both desktop and mobile devices using CSS and React Bootstrap.
